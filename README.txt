Cryptography Final Project
============================================


To run the main program Python3.0 must be installed, and a terminal
emulator (preferably unix based) is advised.


The following steps must be followed:

1. After downloading and extracting the files into a folder,
install virtualenv with the following command:
pip install virtualenv

2. When done, create a new virtual environment with:
virtualenv [environment name]

3. Now, activate that new environment:
source [environment name]/bin/activate

4. After activating the environment install the required libraries
by typing:
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Type
python3 main.py

6. The program should be running successfully. Now you should select
the type of algorithm to use, symmetric, asymmetric, or elliptic curve.

7. Type the text to cipher or hash and the key you want to use. If wanted,
a randomly generated key can be placed by clicking on "Generate Key".

8. Click on "Add Test Vector".

9. Click on "Encrypt".

10. A with a table containing all the relevant data about the algorithm
will pop-up.
